## The Brain behind the Client

This is the server side REST API part of our project using PHP 7 and Laravel.

## Get Requests

This version is a static API allowing a GET request to our groups and users. You can get a list of our groups or individual groups at:

api.localhost/api/groups

api.localhost/api/groups/{id}

## To come

POST, PUT, and DELETE, caching, authentification, unique queries...

## Contributing

Open for discussion in a team setting.

## Security Vulnerabilities

Currently lacking authentification.
